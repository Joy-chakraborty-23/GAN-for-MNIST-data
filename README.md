GAN for MNIST Dataset

This repository implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic handwritten digit images resembling those in the MNIST dataset. The GAN is composed of a generator and a discriminator, trained adversarially to improve performance over time.

Features

Generates synthetic handwritten digits based on the MNIST dataset.

Implements a simple GAN architecture with:

Generator: Fully connected neural network.

Discriminator: Binary classification network.

Trains using PyTorch with options to adjust hyperparameters.

Provides visualization of generated images at different stages of training.

Prerequisites

Libraries and Tools

Make sure the following dependencies are installed:

Python >= 3.7

PyTorch >= 1.10

torchvision >= 0.11

Matplotlib

NumPy

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy

Dataset

The MNIST dataset will be automatically downloaded using PyTorch's torchvision utilities.

Usage

Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gan-mnist.git
cd gan-mnist

Training the GAN

Run the script to train the GAN model:

python train.py

The training script includes default settings for the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs. These can be adjusted by modifying the train.py file.

Visualizing Results

The script saves sample images generated by the GAN in the results directory. To visualize training progress, inspect these images or use the provided visualization script:

python visualize.py

Hyperparameters

Default hyperparameter settings can be found in train.py:

Learning rate: 0.0002

Batch size: 64

Number of epochs: 50

Noise dimension: 100

These can be adjusted to experiment with the GAN's performance.
